# Examplify Install/Update Scripts

A set of scripts to Install or update Examplify on lab devices.

ExamplifyInstall is for machines that ***do not*** have Examplify installed at all.

6. Left-click and then right-click on ExamplifyInstall or ExamplifyUpdate
7. Select "Run with PowerShell"
8. Select "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes to the device.
